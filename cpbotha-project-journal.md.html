These are the development notes of cpbotha's fork of the Real-Time-Voice-Cloning repo.

This is a MarkDeep file, following [the Morgan McGuire Markdeep project Management Method](https://cpbotha.net/2020/03/24/the-morgan-mcguire-markdeep-project-management-method-mmmmm/).

## Tasks

- [ ] integrate NVIDIA apex for faster fp16 training

- [x] add `environment.yml`
- [x] switch to log mel spectrograms
- [x] remove the relu from the encoder output

## Bugs

- [x] Skip non-seekable audio files, else the preprocessor crashes

## Research

- [ ] Try alternative learning rate schemes

- [x] try with batch size 128 (up from default 64)
    - continued training with this batch at around step 52700 thanks to a power outage.
